# Distributed Detection

This repository is a final project for my Resilient Distributed Systems class. A multi-worker image processing system is implemented. Images are received at regular intervals from one or multiple sources and worker processes detect objects in these images. Workers distribute computational load in a decentralized manner, and data is stored in a decentralized manner as well. The database is structured for availability, functionality when partitioned, and eventual consistence (assuming no malicious workers). A simple monitoring process is also used for basic fault detection and management.
